Can divy up tasks via modulo 10 for 10 threads.  Each run is 10 through 19 for each path.
Amount of threads pass in check for (total - 1) and start with zero.

```ruby
# for 10
0 % 10 - 0
# => 0

# for 11
1 % 10 - 1
# => 0

# for 12
2 % 10 - 2
# => 0

# for 13
3 % 10 - 3
# => 0
```

All characters will be mapped by their ordinal value for quantity max checks to permit
`next` to be called in a looping scenario.  Perhaps should use a custom numeric base.
In base digit rollovers if the next character is to be skipped (liek a tens place) skip
that many of the roll over positions amount (hundreds, thousands, etc).


Mapping should not be confused with base roll over position.

When the same file, content, and password is used the only difference in the binary is the ending.
